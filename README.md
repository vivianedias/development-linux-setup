    - installs some extensions
- vim
- curl
- zsh
- oh-my-zsh
    - powerlevel10k

- some git config setup

## How to install it

**Don't forget to change your name and email in the git config section before running the script**

Obs: You may be asked to insert your user password at some point, so keep an eye in the terminal.

Download the .sh file in the repository and make it executable:
```bash
chmod a+x dev-linux-setup.sh
```

Execute the script:
```bash
yes Y | sh dev-linux-setup.sh
```
